## TS Types

Following types are supported in Typescript

- any
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- void
- never
- union
- enums
- object
- unknown
- literals

TS can infer the type of variable from the value assigned.

- TS used duck typing - if it feels the same, it might be same. Like an object having the same set of key:value pairs will have the same type.

- TypeScript uses files known as declaration files as a sort of header file, similar to languages such as C++, in order to superimpose strong typing on existing JavaScript libraries. Thesedeclaration files, which have a .d.ts extension, hold information that describes the available functions and variables that a library exposes, along with their associated type annotations.
