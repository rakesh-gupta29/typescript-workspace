## Literals in TS

This is creating a type not on the basis of data types but on the basis of values i.e. what type of values it can hold.

> Literals provide us with another tool that we can use when we need to define a function that accepts a standard string, number, or boolean, but where we need to limit the values provided to a defined set of values.
