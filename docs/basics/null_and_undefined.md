## Null and Undefined

`undefined` is basically the condition of a variable either not being assigned a value or being deleted.
Along with `undefined`, JavaScript also allows values to be set to null. Setting a value to null is intended to indicate that the variable is known, but has no value, as opposed to undefined, where the variable has not been defined in the current scope.
